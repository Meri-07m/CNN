# YOLO Object Detection on PASCAL VOC Dataset

This repository demonstrates how to implement the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm using the PASCAL VOC dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, providing a comprehensive guide for applying YOLO to real-world object detection tasks.

---
- `data/`: Contains the dataset images and annotations.
- `models/`: YOLO architecture definitions.
- `utils/`: Utility scripts for preprocessing and visualization.
- `train.py`: Model training script.
- `evaluate.py`: Model evaluation script.

## ðŸ“š Dataset Overview

The [PASCAL VOC dataset](https://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/) is a popular benchmark for object detection with annotations for:

- Person
- Car
- Dog
- Horse
- Bicycle
- And more (20 total categories)

pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py --data data/voc.yaml --epochs 50 --batch-size 16 --img-size 416
python evaluate.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --data data/voc.yaml
python utils/visualize.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --images data/images/sample.jpg

### Notes:
- Replace the `![Sample Detection](...)` image URL with an actual hosted image (or upload it to your GitHub repo under `assets/` and update the path accordingly).
- Ensure `requirements.txt` includes necessary packages like `torch`, `opencv-python`, `matplotlib`, etc.

If you'd like help creating the image or uploading it properly to GitHub, let me know!
